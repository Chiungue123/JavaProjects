  <description>In the Reservation Manager project, I'm getting hands-on experience with Java's LinkedHashSet. This small project is part of my ongoing JavaMiniProjects, and it's where I'll focus on practicing some basic operations with this data structure. It's essentially a simple reservation system that will help me better understand how LinkedHashSet works in Java.</description>
