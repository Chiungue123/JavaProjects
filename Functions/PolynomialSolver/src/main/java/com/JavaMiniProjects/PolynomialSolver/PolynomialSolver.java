Functions - Polynomial Solver: Create a class Polynomial that represents a polynomial of any degree. 
This class should have methods for evaluating the polynomial for a given x value, 
finding the derivative of the polynomial, and finding the integral of the polynomial. 
The Polynomial will be represented as an array of coefficients.


 A polynomial is a mathematical expression involving a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients. 
 A simple example of a polynomial is the quadratic equation:

f(x) = ax² + bx + c

Where:

a, b, and c are constants, also known as coefficients.
x is the variable.
ax², bx, and c are terms of the polynomial.
The highest power of a variable in a polynomial dictates the degree of the polynomial. 
For instance, in the above equation, the degree of the polynomial is 2, because that's the highest power of x.

Polynomial equations are widely used in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and many others. 
They are a way to model and solve real-world problems. 
For instance, the laws of motion in physics often involve polynomial equations.

As for the Polynomial Calculator project, it is quite practical as it allows you to apply and understand some of the fundamental concepts in computer science.
This includes data structures, object-oriented programming, and algorithm design. 
It provides an opportunity to use a linked list to store the terms of a polynomial and perform operations on it. 
This project can be an interesting way to dive into mathematical computations while honing your programming skills.
